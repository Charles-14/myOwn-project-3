<h2>story of the game:- In this game, there are two table tennis champions and they meet each other by coincidence. They take with each other and start to debate who is the best but in the end both come to conclusion to battle with each other and prove who is the boss. The next morning they reach the table tennis stadium and battle face to face, but one of the player gets injured while warming up and hurts his hand, and is unable to play the game. All the people were waiting to see their match so they can't even postpone it so the injured player gives you the opportunity to play and tells the opponent player that he will not be able to play the game. So you hold the racket in your hand representing the injured player and go with all your courage to battle with the world's champion table tennis player. Let's see who is the boss of table tennis!</h2>
<h2>Introduction/rules:- This game is a two-player online server game. In this game the two players have 5 lives and each time a player loses to hit the ball, one life is deducted from him. When the life of any player reaches zero and the opposite player's score is 5 then the player with 5 points wins and the other player loses, then the game reaches its end state.</h2>
<h2>Gameplay:- In this game there are two-player positioned opposite to each other, there is a white ball in the center that starts to move when the game is in the play state. The ball first moves randomly to any player and when the player hits it with a racket then the ball moves towards the opposite player. when a player loses to hit the ball he loses 1 life and the opponent player gets 1 point on his scoreboard.
